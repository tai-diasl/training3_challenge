# The challenge was to create a game, giving alternatives and, depending on the choice, it would have a consequence, positive or negative.
# I took the opportunity to reflect on this... every choice we make has consequences... my choice for technology wasn't very obvious to me,
# but I discovered a treasure in this area... I found myself again!
# This is the tip I leave: not always the most obvious path will guide you to a better place. Persist and focus!
