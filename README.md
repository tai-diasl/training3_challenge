# training3_challenge
Create a game using repetition structures and creativity.  I took, as inspiration, the book "Le Comte de Monte-Cristo", by Alexandre Dumas.

The challenge was to create a game, giving alternatives and, depending on the choice, it would have a consequence, positive or negative.
I took the opportunity to reflect on this... every choice we make has consequences... my choice for technology wasn't very obvious to me, but I discovered a treasure in this area... I found myself again!
This is the tip I leave: not always the most obvious path will guide you to a better place. Persist and focus!
